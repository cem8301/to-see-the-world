# To See The World
Python script to display Strava activities on one map! Can be used to see everywhere you have traveled and everywhere you would still like to go. Setup to display multiple athletes at once, so you can visualize your friends travels vs your own! 

##Intentions:
    - Fun project while traveling by bicycle long term
    - Be able to display multiple athletes at once
    - Include fun metrics!
    - Simple
        - Write and run code 100% on my phone
        - Possible to code without internet, or gather data with basic internet
        - Free to develop, no servers or hostnames. It's a carry forward of this project (https://github.com/cem8301/all-of-the-trails) but more versitile
        - Runs fast
        - User friendly (I hope :smile:)

- ideas:
1. distance vs time graph maybe as another html popup
 2. include word cloud!
 3. to summary table, number of states
 4. use admin type name in print out to differntiate spots
